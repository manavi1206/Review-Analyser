## 🔍 High-Impact Insights

### 1. App Instability & Reliability

**Problem:** Users frequently experience app crashes, freezing, login failures, and slow performance, especially during critical market hours, leading to direct financial losses and an inability to execute trades.

**Why This Matters:** This problem is a fundamental breach of trust and directly impacts users' ability to utilize the core product. It leads to missed trading opportunities, substantial financial losses for active traders, and a degraded experience for all users, driving them to more reliable platforms. The concentration of reports on specific dates indicates systemic issues that require immediate attention to prevent widespread churn.

**User Voice:** "[Android | 1★ | 2025-12-05 00:00:00] terrible experience with groww server crash often and not working properly i don't want to give grow even 1 star"

**Segments Affected:** Active traders (highest financial impact), all users (login/crashes affect basic functionality), new users (poor first impression), long-term investors (inability to check/manage portfolios).

### 2. Excessive & Hidden Charges

**Problem:** Users perceive Groww's brokerage and other charges as excessively high, non-transparent, and often hidden, with unexpected deductions and fees for basic account actions like editing personal details.

**Why This Matters:** This issue directly affects user profitability and trust, leading to a strong perception of unfairness and even 'scamming.' It fosters intense resentment and drives users to competitors who offer more transparent or lower fee structures. This is particularly damaging for small capital traders who see their profits significantly eroded, increasing churn and risking brand reputation.

**User Voice:** "[Android | 1★ | 2025-11-20 00:00:00] wrost app ever.... very high brokerage..and hidden charges.. in 7k profit I got only 940 rs.."

**Segments Affected:** Active traders (high brokerage impact), small capital investors (disproportionately affected by fixed charges), all users (erosion of trust and transparency).

### 3. Critical Transaction Failures

**Problem:** Users face severe issues such as delayed refunds, inability to withdraw funds, held amounts, stop-loss orders not executing correctly, and claims of unauthorized stock sales, resulting in significant financial losses.

**Why This Matters:** These are the most critical trust-eroding issues, as they directly involve users' money and lead to tangible financial harm. Such failures carry high reputational and potentially legal risks, as users explicitly mention seeking legal recourse. Unresolved transaction failures can quickly lead to widespread negative publicity, regulatory scrutiny, and a mass exodus of users, irreparably damaging Groww's brand.

**User Voice:** "[Android | 1★ | 2025-11-19 00:00:00] I have bought 300qty shares. when I try to exit with a safe exit. it rejected the order. now, I've lost the 35k amount. The app F&O option didn't work for almost 30 minutes. I want my money back."

**Segments Affected:** All users (refunds, withdrawals, fund security), active traders (order execution, stop-loss failures, F&O traders), new users (poor initial financial experience).
